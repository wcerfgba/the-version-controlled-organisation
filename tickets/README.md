# The Version Controlled Work Ticket System

We present a way to manage items of work such as tasks, stories, support requests using a tickting system implemented in git.

Inside this directory we have a number of directories which represent inboxes. A ticket is represented as a (Markdown) file. A ticket can only be in a single inbox at a time. By creating an appropriate set of inboxes for your organisation you can encode workflows as sequences of inboes which tickets move through. 

[Can inboxes be nested? Allow tickets anywhere?]
