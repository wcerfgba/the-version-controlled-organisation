# The Version Controlled Work Ticket System

We present a way to manage items of work such as tasks, stories, support requests using a tickting system implemented in git.

Inside this directory we have a number of directories which represent inboxes. An inbox can represent a workflow state ("todo, "doing", "done", "blocked", "in review", "in analysis", ...), or assignment to an individual.

A ticket is represented as a (Markdown) file. A ticket can only be in a single inbox at a time.

[Can inboxes be nested? Allow tickets anywhere?]
