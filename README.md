# The Version Controlled Organisation

A Git workflow for modern organisations.

## Manage my organisation with Git? Are you serious?

Yes, I am completely serious. ðŸ˜Š Git -- and the tooling around it -- is capable of providing a simple and complete information infrastructure which can work for many organisations.

Most organisations need at least some of the following things:

* A place to put documents -- authoritative descriptions of business processes, customer portfolios, proposals, receipts, graphics, code, ...
* A system of places for documents -- to keep everything organised
* A shared calendar -- for meetings and events
* A shared task list, workflow management, or project management system -- to organise work, people and processes so everyone knows what they need to do, and so we can ensure we are achieving our goals
* A forum -- somewhere to discuss ideas and vote on proposals [1]

By starting with a few basic processes in the form of this repo, you can use Git to fulfil all of these needs.

The author's primary assumption is that any information necessary for an organisation to function -- goals, processes, coordination, day-to-day communication, ... -- can be communicated by words and diagrams alone. [2] If this is true then it should be possible to manage an organisation using contemporary computing machinery (hardware and software), although providing an ergonomic implementation with simple semantics which achieves all functional requirements seems like it would be quite challenging...

Fortunately within this domain of computing machinery we have had some excellent developments, and we are able to now present an attempt building on this great legacy. 

Here's why Git works:

* **Files = Documents** - Text files like this can capture everything I can think except for possibly diagrams/pictures and music, and for these media we have many filetypes at our disposal. If it's pertinent informtion, I can put it in a computer file.

* **Searchable Hierarchy** - Directories nest into a tree, which if we are careful to structure properly, makes it very easy to know where to put information, and what information is going to be where. If we keep information in suitable filetypes for our organisation -- we are using Git so plain text files should be our default -- then we can search all of our documents very easily, so it becomes very hard to lose things.

* **Unified** - All of your organisation's information is in one place. Have you ever wondered where the 'file' for your Google Calendar lives, or how it's structured? What about your contacts, emails, support tickets, product epics, and customer portfolios? If you bring all of that data into a single platform, you can search everything, cross-reference anything with anything else, using a single set of tools.

* **Changes = Notifications + Provenance + Safety** - Changes to files in the repo happen in the form of commits, which include an author and a message. Every time you pull the repo, you get a list of all the updates to every scrap of information in your organisation: new work in your inbox, meeting time changed, some replies to a query you opened, all listed cleanly in the repo history. The history-like nature of the Git log gives us the wiki effect, allowing us to reverse breaking changes easily, which empowers people to be bold and make changes in the first place.


## How to use this repo

In addition to this document detailing the concept of the Version Controlled Organization, this repo also provides a working implementation and example, based on the theme of a modern SaaS startup. 

Each top level directory represents a distinct 'application' -- a directory structure and files which can be used to manage a particular type of information. Each application contains its own README explaining how it is implemented. If you would like to change the implementation of any applications in the repo, you should to:
* start a thread in the Meta Forum to discuss the potential changes with others
* create a branch with any proposed changes you already have

If your proposal is accepted, a Ticket will be created to finalise your changes and merge them in to master.

## Notes

[1] Many organisations do not have a formal or obvious forum for shop-talk, and many discussions happen around watercoolers, in meetings, and in private email threads / Slack DMs, which might otherwise be beneficial for an organisation to instead take place in a transparent, long-form, and asynchronous way. Just like this document you are reading now. ðŸ˜‰

[2] OK, I am stretching this a bit here, because the bandwidth for emotional communication can become much narrower with just text-based communication. Even a HD video call lacks nuances in body language and voice which form part of our connection to other people and the 'humanness' of our interaction. Any remote organisation with a healthy culture should promote high bandwidth social communication -- imagine if you and your manager never had a 1:1 call! 

That said I do think shop-talk can be contained within a more prescribed boundary. Perhaps we should say any 'operational' information?
