A git workflow for modern organisations.

* A way to manage changes to and revisions of documents
* Templates for common documents 
* A way to manage workload -- who is working on what
* A way to notify people of events
* A place to discuss ideas

* Revisions and signatures -- all changes are timestamped with a commit message and author
