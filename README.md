# The Version Controlled Organisation

A Git workflow for modern organisations.

*Here be dragons! This document and the concepts within are under heavy revision.* 

## Manage my organisation with Git? Are you serious?

Yes, I am completely serious. ðŸ˜Š Git -- and the tooling around it -- is capable of providing a simple and complete information infrastructure which can work for many organisations.

Most organisations need at least some of the following things:

* A place to put documents -- authoritative descriptions of business processes, customer portfolios, proposals, receipts, graphics, code, ...
* A way to structure documents -- to keep everything organised
* A shared calendar -- for meetings and events
* A shared task list, workflow management, or project management system -- to organise work, people, processes and resources so everyone knows what they need to do, and so we can ensure we are achieving our goals
* A forum -- somewhere to discuss ideas and vote on proposals [1]

By starting with a few basic processes in the form of this repo, you can use Git to implement an information platform in which you can manage all of these things.

The author's primary assumption is that any information necessary for an organisation to function -- goals, processes, coordination, day-to-day communication, ... -- can be communicated by words and diagrams alone. [2] If this is true then it should be possible to manage an organisation using contemporary computing machinery (hardware and software), and indeed it is largely realisable with Git. Here's how:

* **Files = Documents** - Text files like this can capture everything I can think except for possibly diagrams/pictures and music, and for these media we have many filetypes at our disposal. If it's pertinent informtion, I can put it in a computer file.

* **Searchable Hierarchy** - Directories nest into a tree, which if we are careful to structure properly, makes it very easy to know where information should live (self-defining) and makes it easy to navigate all information available (self-indexing). If we keep information in suitable filetypes for our organisation -- we are using Git so plain text files should be our default -- then we can search all of our documents very easily, so it becomes very hard to lose things.

* **Unified** - If we keep all of our organisation's information as text files in Git repos, then we have only one set of tooling that we need to learn to manage any information we might encounter. Have you ever wondered where the 'file' for your Google Calendar lives, or how it's structured, how you could search or export the information inside? What about your contacts, emails, support tickets, product epics, and customer portfolios? If you bring all of that data into a single platform, you can search everything, cross-reference anything with anything else, and this can give you superpowers. ðŸ¦¸

* **Commits = Notifications + Provenance + Confidence** - Changes to files in the repo happen in the form of commits, which include an author and a message. Every time you download updates ("pull the repo"), you get a list of all the updates to every scrap of information in your organisation: new work in your inbox, meeting time changed, some replies to a query you opened, all listed cleanly in the repo history. The history-like nature of the Git log brings about the wiki effect, allowing us to reverse breaking changes easily, which empowers people to be bold and make changes in the first place, which propotes innovation, iteration, and moving fast.

## Realising VCO

feature workflows

### Principles

* **`master` is authoritative** - There is a `master` branch that anyone in your organisation can pull to get an accurate and authoritative copy of all information stored in the company repo.

* **Never force-push `master`** - If you are adhering to the principles and implementing your feature workflows, you should never have to force-push `master`. You should never do this because you may cause loss of data. You should probably configure your remotes to disallow force-push on `master`.

* **Pull `master` frequently** - Other people are pushing changes all the time but you need to pull them in order to know about them. Always pull before you push.

* **Commit straight to `master` by default** - Unless there is a process around editing particular files which requires branching, most changes in a VCO repo should be made directly to `master`. If you make a mistake you can always revert.

* **Record all organisational knowledge in the VCO repo** - If you need to communicate with someone, it should probably happen through the repo. Do not email your proposal, put it in an appropriate place in the repo. Do not use a calendar, task list, CRM, wiki, or any other software. If this information is not stored in files in the repo, it will not be available to Git.

* **Use separate repos for access control** - Although making information available to everyone is fine most of the time, most organisations have some information which needs to be restricted to selected eyes. In these instances you should create a separate repository for the department or group to use as a private VCO repo. 

### Notifications

For VCO, the commit log provides a firehose of everything that's happening in your organisation. At the highest level there is the list of commits, and from there we can drill down once to look at the files changed in each commit, and again to look at the changes within each file within each commit.

In addition to increasing the granularity of information visible in the log, we can also filter the commits shown and choose only commits which change particular files, contain specific text, or occur within a given date-time range.

The following aliases -- compatible with bash and zsh and inspired by the git plugin in Oh My Zsh -- provide this functionality:

* `glo` -- One line per commit (commit message wraps), commit hash, human-readable date, author name, and commit message.
* `gls` and `glsr` -- Adds stat output to each commit showing files changed. Variant for reserse ordering.
* `glp` and `glpr` -- Adds stat and diff output to each commit, showing all changes. Another variant for reverse ordering.
* `glf` and `glfr` -- Conveniently filters `glp` output to commits touching given file paths.

```
alias glo='git log --date=human --pretty="%C(auto)%w($COLUMNS,0,44)%h  %>(16,trunc)%ad  %>(12,trunc)%an  %d %s"'
alias gls='glo --stat'
alias glsr='gls --reverse'
alias glp='gls -p'
alias glpr='glp --reverse'
alias glf='glp --'
alias glfr='glpr --'
function glg() { glp --color=always | tr "\1\n" "\n\0" | grep --color=always -a -i "$1" | tr "\0" "\n" | less -R }
```

## How to use this repo

In addition to this document detailing the concept of the Version Controlled Organization, this repo also provides working implementations of various 'applications'. An application in the VCO sense is a directory structure and files which can be used to manage a particular type of information in a particular way. Application templates live in the `/_Apps` directory. In order to use an application, you should 'install' it by copying the template directory and its contents into another location in the repo, and then you can make changes within this 'instance' of the application.

Applications work on a "trunk-based development"-style workflow: changes should be merged into master as soon as possible and everyone should pull master frequently, so everybody stays as close to master as possible. So long as you do not force-push, it is safe to work with most applications by committing straight to master and pushing master: if you do something wrong, someone will quickly notice, let you know [3] and revert the change. 

The remaining files in this repo provide an example of a Version Controlled Organisation on the theme of a modern SaaS startup, VCOCorp. Each top-level directory corresponds to a department at VCOCorp, and provides a workspace for apps and files for each department to use internally. We also have the top-level `/Company` directory for company-wide applications and files -- this is where we share events and notifications that everyone should see, regardless of their department.

Our central hub and 'home page' is the index README file in the Company workspace at [`/Company/README.md`](/Company/README.md), this would be a good document to visit next.

## Notes

[1] Many organisations do not have a formal or obvious forum for shop-talk, and many discussions happen around watercoolers, in meetings, and in private email threads / Slack DMs, which might otherwise be beneficial for an organisation to instead take place in a transparent, long-form, and asynchronous way. Just like this document you are reading now. ðŸ˜‰

[2] OK, I am stretching this a bit here, because the bandwidth for emotional communication can become much narrower with just text. Even a HD video call lacks nuances in body language and voice which form part of our connection to other people and the 'humanness' of our interaction. Any remote organisation with a healthy culture should promote high bandwidth social communication -- imagine if you and your manager never had a 1:1 call! 

That said I do think shop-talk can be contained within a more prescribed boundary. Perhaps we should say any 'operational' information?

[3] This example illustrates an example of an organisational communication use case which is not well-met by Git or VCO, which is real-time signalling. VCO is best supplemented with additional channels for real-time communication.
