## About VCOCorp

VCOCorp is an educational biofuel blockchain Software-as-a-Service company. Founded in 2020 by Anthony Porcelain and Ben Diamond originally as a biodiesel distillery, the duo pivoted to developing the process control systems they developed in-house, into a remote industrial automation SaaS platform for other biofuel companies. After achieving a successful market cap in these areas within the last three years, VCOCorp is now expanding into experimental vertical integrations by collaborating with partners in education and blockchain technologies.

## Notes

[1] **Out of Character** Normally I would expect people to change the root README to serve as a homepage as this file is serving, but it is a very good idea to keep the original VCO documentation in your repo to help people learn how to use everything.
