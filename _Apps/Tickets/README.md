# The Version Controlled Ticket System

We present a way to manage items of 'work' such as tasks, stories, support requests, RFCs, sales leads, ... using a ticketing system implemented in Git.

Each subdirectory contains the ticketing system for each department here at VCOCorp. Each department may organise its system to best achieve its objectives, but the following directories are common to all departments:
* `_Inbox` -- somewhere to put incoming tickets to departments

There is also a `Personal` subdirectory containing a directory for each employee to manage personal and miscellaneous tasks. Please try to organise your day-to-day work within your departmental ticketing workspace as much as possible. ðŸ™‚
